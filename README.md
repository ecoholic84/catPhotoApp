A repo for my HTML/CSS journey thorugh freeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/).
I shall be commiting my progress of every few 10 levels with appropiate comments for easy recall of the lessons.

The aim of this repo is to have a space where I can come back and revisit the basics in case if I need it. This is not a project to be showcased.
